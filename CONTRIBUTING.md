- Add or update docstrings for all public functions and classes.

### Conventional Commits
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated changelog generation. Format your commit messages as:

```

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add new wellness checkin endpoint
fix(agents): resolve PM agent registration issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(wellness): add unit tests for checkin creation
```
