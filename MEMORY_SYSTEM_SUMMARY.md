GET    /memory                    # List memories with filtering
PUT    /memory/{memory_id}        # Update memory
DELETE /memory/{memory_id}        # Soft delete memory
POST   /memory/search             # Advanced search with filters
GET    /memory/stats              # Memory statistics
```

**Advanced Features:**

- **Confidence Filtering**: Filter by minimum confidence score
- **Usage Analytics**: Track most-used memories
- **Automatic Usage Tracking**: Updates usage count on access

### **3. Automated Backup System (`scripts/backup_memory.py`)**
```bash
# Backup Capabilities:
- PostgreSQL: Full database dumps with compression
- MongoDB: Complete database archives
- Redis: All key-value data export
- Corporate Memory: Dedicated memory backup
- Cloud Storage: AWS S3, GCS, Azure Blob support
- Automated Cleanup: Configurable retention policies
```

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Basic backup
python scripts/backup_memory.py --backup-dir ./backups

# With cloud upload
python scripts/backup_memory.py --upload-to-s3 --aws-s3-bucket my-backups

# Full configuration
python scripts/backup_memory.py \
  --postgres-url "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db" \
  --mongodb-url "mongodb://localhost:27017/db" \
  --redis-url "redis://localhost:6379" \
  --upload-to-s3 --aws-s3-bucket my-backups \
